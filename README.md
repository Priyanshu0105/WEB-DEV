## 📖 About This Repo  

This repository is my **personal learning playground** 🌱  
Here, I’ve been exploring everything from **JavaScript basics** to **full-stack development** and **3D rendering with Three.js & React Three Fiber**.  

It’s not a polished product — it’s a **journal of experiments** as I master these technologies step by step.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Covered  

### 🌐 Frontend
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** → fundamentals, async/await, DOM, promises  
- **React.js** → hooks, components, state management  
- **Three.js** → WebGL & 3D rendering  
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** → React renderer for Three.js  
- **drei** → helpers/components for R3F  
- **React Spring** → animations  

### ⚙️ Backend
- **Node.js** → runtime for server-side JavaScript  
- **Express.js** → REST APIs, middleware, routing  
- **MongoDB** → NoSQL database  
- **Mongoose** → MongoDB object modeling  


---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repo  

✅ Document my **learning progress**  
✅ Build a **reference hub** I can revisit later  
✅ Experiment without worrying about production quality  
✅ Evolve selected experiments into **standalone projects**  

---

## 🚧 Next Steps  

- [ ] Refactor and polish selected projects  
- [ ] Create **separate repos** for portfolio-ready apps  
- [ ] Deploy MERN & Three.js projects online  
- [ ] Continue expanding into **DevOps & Generative AI**

## 📌 Note  

This repo is primarily for **learning & practice**.  
Some code may be rough, incomplete, or experimental — the focus is on **understanding concepts** 💡.
